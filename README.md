## Manual Installation

- Visit https://github.com/adrian271/tierhacker if you're not there already
- Find the big green Code button, click it and select Zip file, it should download automatically
- Extract the files out of the zip, you do not need to open anything
- Go to your Google Chrome Browser (although other browsers should support this extension), find your Extensions section of your browser, enable `Developer mode` and click `Load unpacked` and find the folder you just extracted out.
- Find a Tiermaker page you wish to modify, if you're already on a Tiermaker page then you will need to refresh the page

## Future Improvements

- Add functionality to remove items, potentially ones that came with the tiermaker list
- Currently when you add an item, if it's not placed in a tier it can be lost if the browser is refreshed
- Ability to reset entire Tiermaker
- ~~Use a form input instead of a browser prompt to add items~~
- Add history that you can move forward and back through, undo and redo (with keybindings).
- A Tierhacker Twitch Bot or create an integration with existing bots
